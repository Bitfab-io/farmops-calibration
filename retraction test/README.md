#retraction test


##test objective

Discover and setting parameters related to oozing/stringing defects

* The temperature is correctly fiched according to material and nozzle type.
* We are able to print mirrored pieces without stringing.
* Retraction velocity is adapted to avoid excess of material flow.

##Test objet

The 'retraction test' object is calibrating different parameters on our Slic3r (or similar) profile and achieve our printer does not release material on blanck spaces, generated by two different detached parts of the material.


##Generating an object for the new printer

Instructions for generating a new test object for a different printer.

1. Open the 'stl' file on your slicer program.

###Generating gcode for the test

1. Look for the different parameters listed below:

* Length: 3.4 mm
* Z Lift: 0.4 mm
* Speed: 15 mm/s (10 mm/s and 20 mm/s give similar result.)
* Retraction after layer change: on
* Wipe on retraction: on
* Layer height: 0.2 mm
* Printing speed: 20 mm/s
* Travel speed: 250 mm/s

2. Try to interpolate parameters above in your slicing program.
3. Change them freely until you get reasonable good results on you printed piece.

ยก!Remember those parameters are heavily dependant on you nozzle diameter and printing material, so they are only orientative.

##Test instructions

1. Usually we print mirrored pieces to check the stringing defects aswell. You can use Slic3r to set both pieces on the hot bed.
1. Use your sd or Octoprint software in order to print 'retraction-test' gcode.

##Test results

Once printing is done, we will check finished pieces and the presence of filaments and segments.

1. Thin filaments in free space, probably not enough retraction.
2. Thin segments of printed layer, probably to much retraction.

Repeat the test enough times until you get you goals by adjusting your Cura/Slic3r profile.

##Retraction test trouble shooting

* Be sure you are using correct temperature for each type of material
* Check your fan are correctly working.
* You can design you own retaction-test by using a structure of symmetric parts separated by a certain distance.
